# Curated Computer Science Curriculum
## _How to Teach Yourself Computer Science: A Self Taught B.S. level CS Curriculum_

##Introduction
There are tons of free online resources that will help you "Learn Programming Language X," but it's difficult to find courses that will give you a deeper understanding of computer science (CS) like what's taught in a bachelor's level CS program. There is a lot more to CS than what you get from learning languages or going to a webdev bootcamp, so this is an attempt to create self taught curriculum based on the most important courses you'd learn in a typical BS in CS program.

Below you'll find a compilation of resources for teaching yourself the fundamentals of computer science. The categories are based largely off of the [undergraduate pre-requisites for a Master's in Computer Science](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/academics/grad/prereq), with a few extra items based on what seems to be important to the professional CS community. The content was found all over the place, but the wonderful folks at [/r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/) and [/r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) have been especially helpful.

The curriculum is weighted towards interactive courses, followed by static courses with materials and sample exercises, followed by full texts. I've tried to avoid lists of YouTube videos and the like because it's harder to retain information from lectures. These are mostly free resources; however, I've included some books that are too useful not to mention.

# Math:
_Calculus, Statistics, Probability. Computer Science is a branch of mathematics after all._

+ [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - Tons of resources here, but the math courses in particular are convenient and accessible. Select the math you want to know (Probability and Statistics, and Calculus) and Khan Academy will test you and determine what you need to learn to get there.

# Programming Fundamentals:
_The basic concepts of computer science: object-oriented programming, control structures, abstraction etc._

+ [Harvard University's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x#!) - Probably the most well supported MOOC ever. David Malan is a fantastic teacher,  and the class is elegantly put together with lots of videos, examples, and automatically graded assignments. Uses C++.

+ [Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - You are going to need to be familiar with Python, this course will introduce you to Python and teach you basic automation. Uses Python.

# Miscellaneous Skills:
_You don't have to master these skills, but a little knowledge will go a long way._
###_GitHub:_
Git is a version control system for managing software development. Learn how to use git and maintain an active portfolio of your own projects and contributions to other projects on GitHub. Collaborating on open-source software is a great way to learn the invaluable skills of working with other people and writing readable code.

+ [Michael Lee's Curated Programming Resources](https://github.com/Michael0x2a/curated-programming-resources/blob/master/resources.md#programming-languages) - A bunch of material for a bunch of languages.

###_Stack Exchange_
An incredibly useful network of Q&A sites for getting help, it's like Yahoo Answers for people who know what they are talking about. The site is engineered to be as helpful as possible, but it may take a little getting used to. [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=) is dedicated to programming questions.

+ [Meta Stack Exchange FAQ](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7931/faq-for-stack-exchange-sites) - Explains the stack exchange system and how to use it successfully.

# Web Development:

_Making websites._

+ [The Odin Project's: Web Development 101](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101) - A full web development course in and of itself. There may be some repetition here, but it's self-paced so you can breeze through what you already know. Uses Ruby primarily.

>Alternatively, [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) looks like a really interesting project in which you end up spending about  20 weeks building your portfolio by writing code for nonprofits. It's a huge course though (1600 hours), so it might be better to do it alone if you are more interested in web development.
